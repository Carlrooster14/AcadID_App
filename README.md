App Ideas:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  • An app to help university students access their results online without issues (AcadID)

  • An app to help people access and create their national ID card more easily and quickly (ONIKat)

  • An app to help people get first aid before emergency responders arrive (SEKOU+)

Final App Idea:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memento: AcadID

   We noticed that many university students have problems accessing their results from one or several years, especially when they move and cannot go physically to their university campus. The only available way to access their results is in person at their university.
  To solve this problem, we are creating an application with a database where each student will have an identification. Using this ID, every student will be able to access their results anytime and anywhere.

User Stories:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Must have

  • A homepage where students or professors can enter the name of the university

  • A homepage where professors and students can log in (with fields such as name, surname, ID, password, and email)

  • A page for students to choose the session results they want
  
  • A page where students can view their transcript and have the option to download it as a PDF
  
  • A page for professors to see all students’ IDs, with space to enter grades, and a VALIDATE button to save the information after entering it

   Maybe

  • A HELP button if assistance is needed
   
  • A homepage where, if student clicks HELP, they can get assistance
  
  • A homepage with a NOTIFICATIONS button at the top and an AGREE button at the bottom right. The NOTIFICATIONS button would allow students to send messages and images related to their requests for help.
    
  • A notifications button for professors
    
  • A page where, when a professor clicks NOTIFICATIONS, they will see a message saying that a student made a request, along with a SEE INTERVENTION button to review the request

  Would be nice to have
    
  • A way for students to communicate directly with professors
